# SigThing
SigThing is a small tool for players of the awesome mmorpg EVE-Online which allows them to track their path through the universe and discoveries they make during their journey. 
It is the successor of a small tool by the name of "SigTrack" I created before. It took use of the ingame browser (IGB) but lacked in terms of integration.
Since CCP, the creator or EVE-Online, annouced the end of lifetime for the IGB, I had to create something new. And here it is! I hope you find
this program as useful as I do, if not, just dont use it.

## Features
* authentification via OAuth2.
* keylogger to allow you to add your exploration data from within the game without any forms or buttons to press.
* local in-memory database to persist your data.
* nice looking user interface.

## Limitations
* since this app uses the same keylogger as the famous KOSChecker, you actually can't run both programs at the same time.
* some things are still untested. test coverage will increase over the time.
* the application tries to stay on top of all other applications, but sadly this doesnt work if you start the game in fullscreen mode.
